## Here we go again, another server to talk about.

I have moved servers again, this time from the server in the old post to another computer, a old spare Acer Aspire T3-710 my friend had, same Arch VM, and same specs (1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage), we moved to this server so that he could use the full potential of his PC again, as he got a new RTX 3080 TI 12GB GPU for it. (Screw you, anticheats!)

## The specs.

- Intel Core i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GHz
- 12 GB of DDR3 RAM (soon to be 16GB)
- 4TB IronWolf Drive for File Storage, Plex Media, CCTV (same as the old server)
- 480GB Crucial BX500 SATA SSD for Docker and VM storage
- A UPS Battery Backup coming soon. (on the 22nd of February 2023, same with the RAM, and a new IronWolf drive (may or may not be happening), the old one becoming a backup drive.)
