## Talking about the new server
I have now moved my website from Gitlab Pages to a new custom web server hosted on a Arch Linux VM with 1GB of ram and 16GB of storage running under my friend’s server. The old GitLab site is now set up as a redirect to this one.

## About the server itself
### Why the server was started
The reason why my friend’s server was set up is because he has always wanted to have his own HomeLab Server which can host all of the services that he uses while still being able to still have his normal day to day gaming system that he uses. This is how it began. To do this project he has had to run 1 HDMI, 1 DP and 1 USB3 which are all 15m long.
