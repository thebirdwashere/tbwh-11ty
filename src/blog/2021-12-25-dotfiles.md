## My Dotfiles



These are my personal dotfiles, dotfiles are configuration files used by software in Linux and Unix. They are named this because they have a “.” at the beginning (aka a dot). The dot makes the file hidden, and is commonly used with config files. Dotfiles are not always config files, but can be any file that begins with a dot, however the name is usually used for config files.
