## {{ description }}

Hi, my name's Jasmine! (pronouns she/her, they/them works too), and this is my little corner of the internet, mainly to explore web design and self-hosting!

I'm quite the nerdy person, and I've been into computer stuff since a really young age, so that's like half of what I do, computer stuff and rambling about niche stuff that nobody but me really cares about as much as me. Maybe I'll do some of that here too!

### Origin of the name?
Jasmine felt nice so I rolled with it. Oh, you mean my online name?

It's been a long time and one of my friends had to actually teach me the original origin since I had forgotten, but at the time I was using an Animal Crossing picture of Blathers
on one of my friend group chats, and had a similar "WasHere" name already (I made it up on the spot as I had no ideas at the time)

Eventually we discovered Discord nicknames so they started calling me "the bird" and that stuck with me so I merged it with my old name.

I also have chickens so I kinda like birds.

### Things I like!
- Music... lots of music...
- Nature!
- Physical Media (CDs, cassettes, vinyl, videotape, etc.)
- Linux
- Self-hosting services and Homelab type stuff
- Vintage Hi-Fi equipment, including portable audio
- Old Technology (from the 80s to the 2000s)
- 2000s computing (sometimes)
- Older video game consoles (90s to early 2010s)

I've done a bit of programming on the side as well (cough cough BirdBox) but it's not something I'm often into (yet)

Feel free to yap at me over on my [Mastodon](https://mstdn.starnix.network/@thebirdwashere) if you wanna chat!
