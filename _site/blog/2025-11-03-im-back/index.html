        <h2>so, it's been a while...</h2>
<p>I finally got around to rewriting this site, a project I have been thinking about (and procrastinating on too...) for probably a couple years now,
considering the fact the old site was last updated in February 2023, which was partially due to laziness but mainly due to me no longer using Doom Emacs and org-mode
making the old website not very easy to work on, to say the least.</p>
<p>I was talking with some people on IRC and we got onto the topic of making websites, which is where I learned about Eleventy (<a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">www.11ty.dev</a>), which is a static site generator which uses Markdown, amongst other things, while still letting you use all the HTML and CSS you'd like, and I figured that would be a lot easier to work with, and that's what finally sparked my interest in this site again, and it's been pretty fun to work on!</p>
<p>I still have to think of some content to add to the site, especially on the main page, and hopefully work on writing for this blog too!</p>
<p>I'm going to try to stay more active now hopefully, no promises since I'm well known for starting projects, getting bored and then moving on, only to come back months later, the last web related project I did that ended the same way is the website for my Discord bot (<a href="https://birdbox.thebirdwashere.com/">birdbox.thebirdwashere.com</a>) which is also linked on the homepage.</p>
<p>Think that's all I have to write about right now, see ya later!</p>
