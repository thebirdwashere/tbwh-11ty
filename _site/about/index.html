        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>a bit about myself!</h2>
<p>Hi, my name's Jasmine! (pronouns she/her, they/them works too), and this is my little corner of the internet, mainly to explore web design and self-hosting!</p>
<p>I'm quite the nerdy person, and I've been into computer stuff since a really young age, so that's like half of what I do, computer stuff and rambling about niche stuff that nobody but me really cares about as much as me. Maybe I'll do some of that here too!</p>
<h3>Origin of the name?</h3>
<p>Jasmine felt nice so I rolled with it. Oh, you mean my online name?</p>
<p>It's been a long time and one of my friends had to actually teach me the original origin since I had forgotten, but at the time I was using an Animal Crossing picture of Blathers
on one of my friend group chats, and had a similar &quot;WasHere&quot; name already (I made it up on the spot as I had no ideas at the time)</p>
<p>Eventually we discovered Discord nicknames so they started calling me &quot;the bird&quot; and that stuck with me so I merged it with my old name.</p>
<p>I also have chickens so I kinda like birds.</p>
<h3>Things I like!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Music... lots of music...</li>
<li>Nature!</li>
<li>Physical Media (CDs, cassettes, vinyl, videotape, etc.)</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Self-hosting services and Homelab type stuff</li>
<li>Vintage Hi-Fi equipment, including portable audio</li>
<li>Old Technology (from the 80s to the 2000s)</li>
<li>2000s computing (sometimes)</li>
<li>Older video game consoles (90s to early 2010s)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've done a bit of programming on the side as well (cough cough BirdBox) but it's not something I'm often into (yet)</p>
<p>Feel free to yap at me over on my <a href="https://mstdn.starnix.network/@thebirdwashere">Mastodon</a> if you wanna chat!</p>
